# Lemcy

Lemcy is a proof of concept web application for advanced order dining, which allows users to make a reservation as well as order and pay for their food ahead of time. Lemcy is designed to speed up how restaurants can serve their customers, with a goal for restaurants to have drinks and appetizers within 5 minutes of seating. This also allows restaurants to see how many reservations they have and an approximation of meals they need to prepare.
